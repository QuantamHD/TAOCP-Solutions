# TAOCP-Solutions
The solutions to exercises in Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming".

Right now I am working my way through The Art of Comuter Programming trying to answer every question 
I can. While I can't offer you $2.56 if I make a mistake you will have my eternal thanks if you point it
out to me.

If I do happen to make a mistake please file an issue referecing the chapter, section, and problem number.

I will be uploading PDFs of the document from time to time when I feel that I have added signifcant enough 
changes
